# Translated Assets

Translated assets will go here as they are worked on and introduced into the game. 

While an exact workflow hasn't been established, it is possible that we will work from .png asset rips, exporting back to .png, then converting to .bmp to be injected into casts. 

There are folders for the .png and .bmp versions of the translated assets. The directory structure should match the game's directory structure as closely as possible for readability. 

Each folder suffixed with ___.CXT___ indicates a cast file in that directory. All translated images should go inside of their respective cast folder.
