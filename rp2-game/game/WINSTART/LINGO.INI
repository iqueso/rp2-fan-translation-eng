-- This is the text file LINGO.INI.  It is designed
-- to tell Director for Windows what XObjects or
-- DLLs should be loaded when starting DIRECTOR.EXE.

-- You should have a copy of this file and the associated
-- DLL file (for example, FILEIO.DLL) in the same 
-- location as any Projector you wish to distribute.
-- Otherwise, the Projector will not be able to utilize
-- the features of the DLL you want to use.

-- To comment out one of the lines below, use two dashes (--)
-- as in the beginning of these lines.

-- The DLLs or XObjects loaded are:
-- FILEIO.DLL, for file input and output

    -- Following line prevents crashes on Windows systems when using math functions 
    -- such as power or log and passing bogus or extremely large/small values.
    -- Invoking the float->string conversion code  with a valid value prevents
    -- future crashes in this routine.  drs  1mar96
