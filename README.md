Work-in-progress English fan translation for *Roly-Polys' World Tour* (*ローリーポーリーズの世界旅行*)

Released November/December 1997, Developed by OutSide Directors Company, published by Shinko Music Entertainment.


# About

*Roly-Polys' World Tour* (*Roly-Polys' 2*, or *RP2* as referred to in this repo) is made with Macromedia Director 5. This translation works by modifying cast members in cast (*.cxt*) files using Director 5. We are replacing cast member images containing Japanese text with modified images with English text. We then replace the original cast member file (*.cxt*), with our own cast member file. The game will then play our new cast file after replacing the original cast file with it.
