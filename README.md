Released November/December 1997, Developed by OutSide Directors Company, published by Shinko Music Entertainment.


# About

*Roly-Polys' World Tour* (*Roly-Polys' 2*, or *RP2* as referred to in this repo) is made with Macromedia Director 5. We are able to open "protected" (*.cxt*) cast files in Director. We replace cast member images containing Japanese text with modified images with English text. We then replace the original cast member file (*.cxt*), with our own cast member file. After taking into consideration the original assets' location and "registration point" values, as well as the name of the cast member, the game will use our modified file as if it were the original. We have written scripts to automate this process (See *scripts* directory).
