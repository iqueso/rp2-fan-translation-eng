Work-in-progress English fan translation for *Roly-Polys' World Tour* (*ローリーポーリーズの世界旅行*)

Released November/December 1997, Developed by OutSide Directors Company, published by Shinko Music Entertainment.


# About

*Roly-Polys' World Tour* (*Roly-Polys' 2*, or *RP2* as referred to in this repo) is made with Macromedia Director 5. This translation works by modifying cast members in cast files (.cxt extension) using Director 5. We are replacing cast member images containing Japanese text with modified images with English text. We then replace the original cast member file (.cxt), with our own cast member file. The game will then play our new cast file after replacing the original cast file with it.
